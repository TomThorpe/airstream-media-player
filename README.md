==NO LONGER SUPPORTED DUE TO WORK AND TIME COMMITMENTS - SORRY!==
The latest reports from people seem to indicate this application doesn't function well on ios devices anymore. Sorry. I might get time to update it in the future, but can't guarantee it. The code is open source, so I'm leaving it here for now and will be happy to add patches from people if anyone wants to upgrade it!

Due to work commitments, it looks unlikely that I will get chance to update this project any time soon to support the latest features in iOS5+. I'm leaving this project here for reference only in case I ever do get chance to update it, but I can't guarantee support from now on - sorry! 

A well known motherboard manufacturer has been in touch recently and asked to fork the code to include on their motherboard driver disks in the future, so hopefully this won't be the last of the air stream media player!

Also, if anyone would like to continue with this project the source code is still on here, please feel free to get in touch and request write-access to the repository and contribute to the project.

Thanks for all your support and downloads!

Tom

===Update===
Hi,

Due to starting a new job I haven't had chance to try the airstream media player with iOS 4.3 (I haven't even got it installed on my iPhone yet!), but hopefully I will be able to soon. Depending on how apple have implemented the new in-app airstream in 4.3, I might hopefully be able to add it if it doesn't work already. It'll depend on whether Apple have encrypted it or not.

If anybody can send me any details it'll speed up the process loads! Otherwise, keep an eye on this page!

Cheers,
Tom

===New: Version 1.1===
Changes:
  * Added the ability to save the image files that you stream to the application as jpg, bmp, gif or png, using the "Image" toolbar menu option
  * Minimise to system tray (displays a message to tell you this has happened, to stop this message appearing again, click it)
  * Added the option to automatically start videos in fullscreen mode. If used in conjunction with minimising to the system tray, the application can be left constantly running in the background and will only appear when something is streamed to it.
  * Added an icon instead of using the default icon for applications.
Go to the Downloads section to download the latest version. If you have a previous version, to upgrade just delete the old version and use this one instead.

=Air Stream Media Player=
An Airplay client for windows to allow you to stream pictures and YouTube videos from iOS devices to a Windows computer with .NET installed.

Requires .NET framework v3.5 or higher and Bonjour to be installed. If using anything less than Windows 7 also needs Quicktime installed to play videos. Most computers will already have all of these installed.

If the application detects that you do not have quicktime installed, it will try to use Windows Media Player instead. This may or may not work depending on what codecs you have installed. 

If you do have quicktime installed the application will default to using it, but you will have the choice of switching to windows media player instead in the File menu.
